# Home-Automation
Problem:
The main issue was fixing an old system in a house that made it hard to control things like lights and the air conditioner. The system also needed to be updated to a newer version of a small computer called a Raspberry Pi, but there were some problems with different versions of the Python programming language that needed to be solved. Plus, the system needed better communication between the Raspberry Pi and another small device called Arduino.

Solution:
Making Everything Better:
I made the whole system better so it could control the temperature in the house more effectively and check on the system's performance more easily. After I was done, the person I was helping was really happy because everything worked much better than before.

Better Communication with MQTT Protocol:
I used something called the MQTT protocol to make the Raspberry Pi and Arduino talk to each other better. This made the system more reliable and work better together.

Updating to the Newest Raspberry Pi:
I changed the system to work with the newest version of the Raspberry Pi. I had to be careful to make sure the programming language Python worked well with this new version, and I managed to do that successfully.

Testing and Setting It Up:
I tested everything a lot to make sure it all worked perfectly. Then, I set up the system in the person's house. In the end, everything worked just as it should, and the person was really happy with it.

Tools I Used:
I used Python (a programming language), Virtual Manager (a tool for managing computers), Raspberry Pi (a small computer), and Arduino (another small device) to fix and improve the system.
